            <p class="about">USIT, short for Undergraduate Students Interested in Technology, is a student-run organization located at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The club aims to bring together students of all backgrounds, majors, and experience levels that have some degree of interest in technology in order to create a space that fosters learning outside of the classroom in a low-stress environment. Along with creating a community, USIT aims to host workshops, outside speakers, and provide resources about tech-related paths for post-graduation. </p>
