            <h1>Undergraduate Students Interested in Technology</h1>
            
            <p class="home">
            Are you curious (or maybe a little apprehensive) when using computers?<br>
            Do you like learning new things?<br>
            Do you like creating and building things?<br>
            Do you want to meet new people?<br>
            Are you a student at UMass Amherst?
            </p>
            
               <p class="home">If you answered yes to any of the above, check out USIT, a student-run organization at UMass Amherst that believes that everyone, regardless of major or experience level, deserves access to (and experience with) technology.</p>

            <p class="home">USIT was founded in January 2018 by Alicia Bochnak and Sarah Manlove. The idea for this organziation was inspired by their experience at SheHacks Boston, a student-run hackathon for women and femme-nonbinary individuals. The hackathon encouraged people of all backgrounds, experience levels, and identities to participate, which was an idea that Alicia and Sarah wanted to bring back to UMass.</p>
